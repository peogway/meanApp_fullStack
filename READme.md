The project uses angular/cli for the frontend, and express for backend. It can be easily set up: download the source code, extract it and run the command "npm i --force" in correct path. After installation, the application will be available with comand "npm run dev".

The app can be used to manage tasks, works properly. Users can add, delete, as well as mark which task is important. It also provides us registration and login, so everyone can create separate accounts to manage their works.
